these are things that i need to do but often only think of them in those
moments where you are falling asleep or are way too busy to deal with
your own shit and then forget all about them by the time im bored and need
something to do.

* document Avenue\RouteHandler to explain :Path: ::Path:: and how to get custom
  regex evaluated.

* when you edit atlantis.json manually there is no web.atl or ssl.atl option
  to regenerate the apache.conf or acmephp.yml that does not involve stepping
  through the wizard. its fine but add --update to skip wizard.
